# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Sebsibe Solomon and I are working together on this project, which is a joint assignment that involves teamwork. We have established effective communication channels to exchange our thoughts and feedback, and we distribute the workload fairly between us. We have broken down the project into smaller parts and assigned each one to one of us. We use online platforms such as Google Docs and Zoom to work collaboratively and synchronously. We also hold frequent meetings to update each other on our status, difficulties, and solutions. We value each other's views and perspectives, and we offer helpful criticism and recommendations. We are dedicated to producing a high-standard project that fulfills the expectations and requirements.

Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
Python Unit Tests
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
All your test files and folders should start by test_
Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

More Info
Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
